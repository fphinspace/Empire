# Empire
Empire game ported from Dec VAX. Modified to run on Mac PPC and then Mac Intel.

Note: Game state is save in a file called empsave.dat.  This file is not portable between
different endian machine architectures (i.e. PPC and Intel).  

Also, I rename copies of empsave.dat and save them in the directory save in case I want to
return to them
